# CSS Layouts

## Introduction

Layouts are the way text,images and other content are placed and arranged on a webpage.

In other words, the visual structure of our content.

## Layout Category

We can separate layouts into two main categories.

- Page Layout.
- Component Layout.

## Layout Tools

We have different tools to build layouts using CSS

- Float (not commonly used anymore)
- Flexbox
- Grid

### Float

Floats are the _old school_ way of building layouts so I won't dive deep into them.

### Flexbox

Allows us to lay out elements in 1 dimension (row or column).

The main use case is to place elements inside a component.

### CSS Grid

Allows us to lay out elements in a 2 dimensional grid.

Very useful for page layouts or complex components.
