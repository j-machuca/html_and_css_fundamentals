- Plain
  - Neutral or small typefaces, structured layout.
- Bold/Confidence
  - Big and bold typography, bright colors and blocks.
- Calm
  - Used mainly for products and services, calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, matching images/illustrations
- Startups
  - Medium sized sans serif typefaces, light grey text and backgrounds, rounded elements.
- Playful

# Key Components of Design

## Typography

### Serif

Serif typefaces have the curves and small details on the corners.

Usually used for more traditional/classic look and feel.
Good for long text.

### Sans-serif

The sans-serif type face have no decorations.
Usually provide a more modern and cleaner look and feel.

### Picking fonts

One of the most popular sites to find fonts is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Its recommended to stay with 1 or two typefaces at the most.

Some example of sizes:

|  Size   | Use Case                        |
| :-----: | :------------------------------ |
| 16-32px | plain text                      |
| 24px->  | long text                       |
| 48px->  | Headlines (can be bold as well) |

### Readability

Text with a font weight of 400 is plain text and tends to be hard to read.

Try to limit text to 75 characters per line.

Line height should be between 1.2-1.5 for regular text.
For bigger text try to remain below 1.5.
The smaller or longer the text is the larger the line height.

If big text looks unnatural try reducing the letter spacing.

For short titles, test using all caps and increase letter spacing.

Usually text should be aligned to the left. Only center text for specific use cases.

## Colors

Colors used for the website should also reflect the personality or the style of image the company wants to convey.

Some basic color concepts/theory:

| Color  | Meaning                                                            |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red    | Draws a lot of attention. Symbolizes power,passion and excitement. |
| Orange | Less aggressive. Happiness, cheerful, creative.                    |
| Yellow | Joy, brightness, Intelligence                                      |
| Green  | Harmony,nature,growth and health                                   |
| Blue   | Peace, trust,professionalism                                       |
| Purple | Wealth,wisdom,magic                                                |
| Pink   | Romance,care and affection                                         |
| Brown  | Nature,durability and comfort                                      |
| Black  | Power,elegance, minimalism, but also grief and sorrow              |

### Creating a color palette

Select at least 2 colors, one main color and one grey color (can be a very dark version of another color).

Another color to add could be an accent color. Must have a relation to the main and grey color.

After selecting the main,accent and grey color it is also common to create tints(lighter versions) and shades(darker versions) of the three main colors.

Colors allow us to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.

Using accent colors make entire components or sections stand out.

Its important to use images and illustrations that use the same colors.

On dark colored backgrounds try using a tint of the main or accent color.

When possible avoid using black text, try dark versions of the main or accent colors.

Always check the contrast between text color and background color.

- For small text `4.5:1` contrast
- For large text `3:1`

## Images/Illustrations

Images in a website can be placed into 4 categories:

- Product Photos
- Storytelling
- Illustrations
- Patterns

Images should be used to support the website's message and story.

If you are going to add text on images consider:

- Making the image darker or brighter. (i.e. using a gradient)
- Postion text in a neutral area. (where the text does not interfere with the rest of the image).
- Put the text on a box with a background with a plain background.
- Always account for high-resolution screens but remember to compress images.

## Icons

Icons can change the look and feel of the page or application.

There are a lot of icon packs available online always go for `svg` icons.

Always consider the roundness,weight and filled/outlined icons that match websites personality and typography.

Icons help provide visual assistance to the text.

- Features
- Actions
- Bullet points

We can use icons and have them set to the same color of the text. When we want to draw attention we can use a different color.

Try adding backgrounds to the icon to make it look bigger if the icon does not look good when scaled up.

## Shadows

Shadows are used to create a sense of depth in the interface and draw attention.

As the shadow on the element gets bigger it makes the element seem farther away from the screen.

Too many shadows may lead to a poor overal design defeats the point of creating depth.

Always use light shadows, making them too dark will result in a poor design.

Small shadows should be used to draw attention to certain elements.

Medium sized shadows should be used to draw attention to sections or cards to make them stand out.

Large shadows are usually used for navigation, popups or modals.

Adding shadows on user interaction (hover,click) will give a better feeling when interacting with the elements.

Shadows don't have to be black.

## Border Radius

Making elements have a more noticeable border radius makes elements and overall design look more playful.

Typeface is a key factor to help us determine the radius of the containers and elements in the overall design.

Border radius is usually present in the following elements

- Buttons
- Images
- Around icons (icon containers)
- Standout sections
- Cards
- Popovers
- Modals

## Whitespace

Whitespace as the name suggests is the space that exists between elements.

It helps the user understand how pieces are information are related to each other.

Allows us to separate elements and declutter the interface.

Elements that are closer to each other are related.
