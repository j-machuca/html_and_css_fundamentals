# Key Components of Design

## Typography

### Serif

Serif typefaces have the curves and small details on the corners.

Usually used for more traditional/classic look and feel.
Good for long text.

### Sans-serif

The sans-serif type face have no decorations.
Usually provide a more modern and cleaner look and feel.

### Picking fonts

One of the most popular sites to find fonts is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Its recommended to stay with 1 or two typefaces at the most.

Some example of sizes:

|  Size   | Use Case                        |
| :-----: | :------------------------------ |
| 16-32px | plain text                      |
| 24px->  | long text                       |
| 48px->  | Headlines (can be bold as well) |

### Readability

Text with a font weight of 400 is plain text and tends to be hard to read.

Try to limit text to 75 characters per line.

Line height should be between 1.2-1.5 for regular text.
For bigger text try to remain below 1.5.
The smaller or longer the text is the larger the line height.

If big text looks unnatural try reducing the letter spacing.

For short titles, test using all caps and increase letter spacing.

Usually text should be aligned to the left. Only center text for specific use cases.

## Colors

Colors used for the website should also reflect the personality or the style of image the company wants to convey.

Some basic color concepts/theory:

| Color  | Meaning                                                            |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red    | Draws a lot of attention. Symbolizes power,passion and excitement. |
| Orange | Less aggressive. Happiness, cheerful, creative.                    |
| Yellow | Joy, brightness, Intelligence                                      |
| Green  | Harmony,nature,growth and health                                   |
| Blue   | Peace, trust,professionalism                                       |
| Purple | Wealth,wisdom,magic                                                |
| Pink   | Romance,care and affection                                         |
| Brown  | Nature,durability and comfort                                      |
| Black  | Power,elegance, minimalism, but also grief and sorrow              |

### Creating a color palette

Select at least 2 colors, one main color and one grey color (can be a very dark version of another color).

Another color to add could be an accent color. Must have a relation to the main and grey color.

After selecting the main,accent and grey color it is also common to create tints(lighter versions) and shades(darker versions) of the three main colors.

Colors allow us to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.

Using accent colors make entire components or sections stand out.

Its important to use images and illustrations that use the same colors.

On dark colored backgrounds try using a tint of the main or accent color.

When possible avoid using black text, try dark versions of the main or accent colors.

Always check the contrast between text color and background color.

- For small text `4.5:1` contrast
- For large text `3:1`
